# Time Invested
I've spend 4 hours plus 30 mins for README and Unit Test Cases. I've logged my time while working (Like a freelancer working mechanism)

# Time Distribution
The architecture and applying game logics took almost %50 of my time.
The rest is creating UI components and writing test cases.

## Distribution
- UI Components -> 1 hour
- File Parsing, Word Pair generation, game state and game flow -> 2 hours
- Refactoring, Unit Testing, preparing README -> 1 hour

# Decisions made because of restricted time
- I created the structures and modules dependency free as much as I can. 
- I've tried the separate the gaming logics and UI as much as I can.
- Used SnapKit to generate constraints faster.

# What would have been improved
- If there was extra time, I would have write more test cases. I couldn't achieve the full coverage.
- I could have documented codebase very well if I have more time.

# 3rd Party
I've used SnapKit to generate constraints slightly faster than traditional way.
